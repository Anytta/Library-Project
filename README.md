This is a final project from studies that consisted in writing, implementing and testing a Library Management Computer System in Java for a library administrator.

The library has a catalogue of items and a number of members (users). Users may borrow and return items from the library. The library administrator may add and delete items from the library catalogue. The library administrator may view the membership list and view all items in the library catalogue. The library administrator may also search for an item in the library catalogue whose title begins with a particular search string.
